## [AntaresInvest](https://github.com/lucarammel/antaresinvest)
AntaresInvest is an extension of the Antares Simulator, used to model the European power system. While Antares focuses on unit commitment and dispatch, AntaresInvest simulates multi-year investment decisions. It calculates revenues from the energy-only market based on Antares results and incorporates other market mechanisms like capacity remuneration. Investors make decisions to retire or invest based on economic assumptions, influencing the power fleet, which is updated over multiple iterations.

## [LoadModel](https://github.com/lucarammel/loadmodel)
Deep learning methods to estimate end-use load profiles and total load curve using historical data mostly from developped economies. The model is based on a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) used for each end-use aimed to be disaggregated from the total load.

## [MySQL2Postgre](https://github.com/lucarammel/MySQL2Postgre)
This tool facilitates the migration of data from MySQL to PostgreSQL, ensuring the synchronization of table structures and column names, followed by data migration in batches. It handles various aspects of the migration process, including schema and table creation, data transfer, and sanity checks to verify data integrity

## [Corrclim](https://github.com/lucarammel/corrclim)
A R toolbox for facilitating climatic correction of timeseries and the implementation of new models.
